# First-Blog-Site
This is a blog website that was created as a project from The Complete 2022 Web Development Bootcamp - Angela Yu
This was created using HMTL, CSS, JS, EJS, and Node.js
You can use "localhost:3000/compose" to write a new blog post. When created, will re-route you to the home page where you can select "Read More" and will create a separate page where you can view that specific blog.
